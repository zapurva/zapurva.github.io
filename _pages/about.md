Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am a researcher in the broad field of robotics looking to collaborate with experts in the domain of unmanned systems, logistics and agriculture. 

I recently graduated with a PhD from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and Monash University. My thesis was titled "Experiments in modeling and control of multi-agent systems". My advisors were [Prof. Debraj Chakraborty](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dc), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and [Dr. Hoam Chung](http://users.monash.edu.au/~hchung/), Monash University.

Current Research
================
My current research is focused on aerial delivery logistics, perception systems for UAVs and UAV traffic management (UTM). I'm also dabbling in hydroponics.

My PhD research was focused on experimental work in modeling and control of physical multi-vehicle systems. We have implemented control algorithms to achieve autonomous co-operative behaviour on multi-vehicle aerial systems. These vehicles accomplish tasks like rendezvous maneuvers and maintaining formations under different conditions, without requiring a central coordinator. Also, a model is developed for vehicular traffic for conditions wherein human drivers do not follow lane discipline. This highly complex interactive behavior is observed, and laws of interaction are proposed and verified.
