Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am currently a PhD candidate at the IITB-Monash Research Academy working on "Cooperative control of Unmanned Aerial and Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) Groups". My advisors are [Prof. Debraj Chakraborty](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/dc), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and [Dr. Hoam Chung](http://users.monash.edu.au/~hchung/), Monash University.

Current Research
================
My work focuses on development, implementation and experimental validation of control algorithms and communication protocols which can be used by UAV teams for effective collective behaviour. The developed control algorithms guarantee various properties like convergence and time-optimality by using only locally exchanged information. The developed communication protocol enables guaranteed real-time, collision-free information exchange between multiple agents and can be implemented on-board the multi-agent UAVs, thus removing dependence on ground stations.  

For details please do visit the Projects page.

Research Interests

	* Unmanned Vehicles: on-board trajectory planning with obstacle avoidance
	* Human-in-loop operations
	* Control + Communication Architectures for safe and reliable operations

* Urban Farming
